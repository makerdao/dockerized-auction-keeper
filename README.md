# dockerized-auction-keeper

`dockerized-auction-keeper` contains a preconfigured [auction-keeper](https://github.com/makerdao/auction-keeper) that follows a simple FMV discount pricing model. With docker as the only prerequisite, this instance is well-suited for first-time auction keeper operators.

Note: Docker image will be created based on current master branch when you first run the keeper. If you want to rebuild image
with latest master make sure keepers are stopped then run `./cleanup.sh` script

### Install Prerequisite

- **Install Docker Community Edition for your OS:**
```
https://docs.docker.com/install/
```
- **Install Docker Compose for your OS:**
```
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
```

### Setup flip-eth-a keeper

After following the setup procedure below, this keeper works out of the box under the following configuration:
- Participates in up to 100 active ETH-A Flip auctions; it does not start new ones
- Begins scan at a prescribed auction id - we recommend starting at:
  - `mainnet` - 4500
  - `kovan` - 1800
- Looks for Vaults (i.e. `urns`) at a supplied block height - we recommend starting at the block that `Vat` was deployed:
  - `mainnet` - 8928152
  - `kovan 1.0.2` - 14764534
- Uses a pricing model that tracks the price of ETH via a public API and applies a `DISCOUNT` before participating
- All logs from the keeper are saved and appended to a single `auction-keeper-flip-ETH-A.log` file

- Create a a folder in the root directory of the repo called `secrets`
- Place unlocked keystore and password file for account address under `secrets` directory
- Configure following variables in `environment_flip.sh` file:
    - `SERVER_ETH_RPC_HOST`: URL to ETH Parity node. If using parity from this repository use `http://parity`
    - `SERVER_ETH_RPC_PORT`: ETH RPC port
    - `ETHGASSTATION_API_KEY`: eth gas station API KEY, can be applied for at https://data.concourseopen.com/
    - `FIRST_BLOCK_TO_CHECK`: Recommendation under introduction section
    - `FLIP_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`: address to use for bidding
    - `FLIP_ETH_A_ACCOUNT_KEY`: account key format of `key_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/keystore.json,pass_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/password.txt`
    Note: path to file should always be `/opt/keeper/secrets/` followed by the name of file you create under secrets directory
    Ex: if you put `keystore-flip-a.json` and `password-flip-a.txt` under `secrets` directory then var should be configured as
    `FLIP_ETH_A_ACCOUNT_KEY='key_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/keystore-flip-a.json,pass_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/password-flip-a.txt'`
    - `FLIP_DAI_IN_VAT`: Amount of Dai in Vat (Internal Dai Balance); important that this is higher than your largest estimated bid amount
    - `FLIP_MINIMUM_AUCTION_ID_TO_CHECK`: Recommendation under introduction section
    - `FLIP_ETH_DISCOUNT`: Discount from ETH's FMV, which will be used as the bid price
    - `FLIP_GASPRICE`: Fixed GWei price used in bid participation

### Setup flop keeper

- Create a a folder in the root directory of the repo called `secrets`
- Place unlocked keystore and password file for account address under `secrets` directory
- Configure following variables in `environment_flip.sh` file:
    - `SERVER_ETH_RPC_HOST`: URL to ETH Parity node. If using parity from this repository use `http://parity`
    - `SERVER_ETH_RPC_PORT`: ETH RPC port
    - `ETHGASSTATION_API_KEY`: eth gas station API KEY, can be applied for at https://data.concourseopen.com/
    - `FIRST_BLOCK_TO_CHECK`: Recommendation under introduction section
    - `FLOP_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`: address to use for bidding
    - `FLOP_ACCOUNT_KEY`: account key format of `key_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/keystore.json,pass_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/password.txt`
    Note: path to file should always be `/opt/keeper/secrets/` followed by the name of file you create under secrets directory
    Ex: if you put `keystore-flop.json` and `password-flop.txt` under `secrets` directory then var should be configured as
    `FLOP_ACCOUNT_KEY='key_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/keystore-flop.json,pass_file=/opt/keeper/secrets/password-flop.txt'`
    - `FLOP_DAI_IN_VAT`: Amount of Dai in Vat (Internal Dai Balance); important that this is higher than your largest estimated bid amount
    - `FLOP_MKR_DISCOUNT`: Discount from MKR's FMV, which will be used as the bid price
    - `FLOP_GASPRICE`: Fixed GWei price used in bid participation

### Run

flip-eth-a keeper
`./start-keeper.sh flip-eth-a | tee -a -i auction-keeper-flip-ETH-A.log`

flop keeper
`./start-keeper.sh flop | tee -a -i auction-keeper-flop.log`

### Shutdown
This will gracefully stop keeper and will exit DAI / collateral from Vat contract to keeper operating address

flip-eth-a keeper
`./stop-keeper.sh flip-eth-a`

flop keeper
`./stop-keeper.sh flop`

### Optional additions

Other auction keepers can be added in `docker-compose.yml` e.g. for a BAT flipper
- add startup scripts `flip-bat.sh` and `model-bat.sh` files under `flip/bat` directory
- configure any new env vars used by startup scripts in `environment.sh` script (e.g. `ACCOUNT_FLIP_BAT_KEY`)
- add keeper in `docker-compose.yml`
```
  flip-bat:
    build: .
    image: makerdao/auction-keeper
    container_name: flip-bat
    volumes:
      - $PWD/secrets:/opt/keeper/secrets
      - $PWD/flip/bat/flip-bat-a.sh:/opt/keeper/flip-bat.sh
      - $PWD/flip/bat/model-bat.sh:/opt/keeper/model-bat.sh
      - $PWD/environment.sh:/opt/keeper/environment.sh
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "100m"
        max-file: "10"
    command: /opt/keeper/flip-bat-a.sh model-bat.sh
```
- start it as `./start-keeper.sh flip-bat | tee -a -i auction-keeper-flip-BAT.log`

A local parity node can also be started from this repository with:

```
docker-compose up -d parity
```

- The configuration mounts a volume from `~/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/docker/` meaning synchronization will persist between restarts.
- out of the box parity will sync mainnet. To use Kovan, add `--chain kovan` to docker-compose.yml. e.g.:

```yaml
command: [
  "--chain", "kovan",
  "--warp",
  "--warp-barrier", "14764534",
```
